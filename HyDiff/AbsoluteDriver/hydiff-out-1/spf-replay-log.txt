[1;91m[-] [0mHmm, your system is configured to send core dump notifications to an
    external utility. This will cause issues: there will be an extended delay
    between stumbling upon a crash and having this information relayed to the
    fuzzer via the standard waitpid() API.

    To avoid having crashes misinterpreted as timeouts, please log in as root
    and temporarily modify /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern, like so:

    echo core >/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern

[1;91m[-] [0mWhoops, the target binary crashed suddenly, before receiving any input
    from the fuzzer! There are several probable explanations:

    - The current memory limit (50.0 MB) is too restrictive, causing the
      target to hit an OOM condition in the dynamic linker. Try bumping up
      the limit with the -m setting in the command line. A simple way confirm
      this diagnosis would be:

      ( ulimit -Sv $[49 << 10]; /path/to/fuzzed_app )

      Tip: you can use http://jwilk.net/software/recidivm to quickly
      estimate the required amount of virtual memory for the binary.

    - The binary is just buggy and explodes entirely on its own. If so, you
      need to fix the underlying problem or find a better replacement.

    - Less likely, there is a horrible bug in the fuzzer. If other options
      fail, poke <lcamtuf@coredump.cx> for troubleshooting tips.
